= Neovim Nightly Homebrew Tap
:uri-neovim: https://neovim.io/
:uri-repo: https://github.com/vhqkze/homebrew-tap

This repository is a {uri-repo}[Homebrew tap] for installing nightly builds of {uri-neovim}[Neovim] on macOS.

The formula provided is `neovim-nightly`.

== Installation

To add this tap to your Homebrew setup, run the following command:

[source,sh]
----
brew tap vhqkze/tap
----

== Usage

Once the tap is configured, you can install the Neovim nightly build with:

[source,sh]
----
brew install neovim-nightly
----

To upgrade to the latest available nightly build:

[source,sh]
----
brew upgrade neovim-nightly
----

=== Conflicts with Official Neovim

This formula conflicts with the official `neovim` formula from `homebrew-core`. This is because both formulas install a binary with the same name (`nvim`). You can only have one version installed at a time.

If you have the official `neovim` installed, you will need to uninstall it before installing `neovim-nightly`:

[source,sh]
----
brew uninstall neovim
brew install neovim-nightly
----

== Automation

The `neovim-nightly` formula in this repository is automatically updated every day at approximately 05:25 UTC. A GitHub Actions workflow fetches the latest release information from the official Neovim repository and updates the formula file with the new version and checksums.
